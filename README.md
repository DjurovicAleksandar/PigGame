## Overview

Pig Game is a multiplayer game built with javascript.

We have 2 players and each of them has to roll the dice. each time that they roll the dice the number is added to the current score and if you want you can click he hold button to hold the scores if not you can go on untill the dice rolls to 1, at that moment all the scores you have achieved through that turn will set to zero and the next player must roll the dice and the first player who achieves 100 points will be the winner.
